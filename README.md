## Inspiration💡

The term alone provided some inspiration.The stage here is WhatsApp. Twilio is the figurative drape (metaphorical curtain) .We're attempting to construct a drama that is based on real life, with the actors being the sender and recipient of the anonymous communication.

## What it does💪

It basically takes input in the form of a WhatsApp number from one of the characters in the story, followed by an anonymous text from another character in the story. And it results in the message, which is the given input, being sent as an anonymous message to the recipient via WhatsApp, and the drama continues based on the message. And it's depends on the user how they continue their story. And the conversion can be converted to image which gets uploaded in DeSo Blockchain and we can even convert it into NFTs.

## How we built it ❓🧠
We made it with ♥  and in the love for _Theater and Cinema_

We built it using Python, Pillow Library with **Twilio**and  **DeSo**.

##Twilio 📞

Twilio was used as a customer engagement platform for the characters in the story.
We included Whats App.The anonymous message will be delivered to the recipient via WhatsApp. 

#Deso🧱⛓️
It uploads the text-generated image to the DeSo blockchain, which can then be viewed on the diamond app or bit clout and converted into NFTs. 

##Pillow👼🏼
We used Pillow Library of Python to convert text into an image.

## Challenges we ran into🧗

-We had Twilio issues at first, with errors in sending messages to the desired WhatsApp contact.

-Also, we had a lot of trouble with Pillow because we couldn't create a responsive image for the text at first, which we later figured out. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of🎗️🏆 

-We are pleased that we were able to complete the project in such a short period of time.

-We were able to use WhatsApp via Twilio for the first time for two of us, and for the others, it was their first time running it. 

## What we learned 👨‍🎓

-We tried to be creative based on the theme. 

-We Learned ro use Twilio and Pillow

## What's next for Texnymous

We aim to use GUI to make it more interactive and train it well to produce even better output.

We also aim to further explore how to create and sell nfts.
